\subsection{Translucent transport mode}\label{ILP_Transluc_Mode}

The translucent mode has the particularity of while some nodes use electrical and optical part others use only electrical part. But for a better definition of the model we will take into account the following particularities:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $N_{OXC,n}$ = 1, \quad $\forall$ n that process traffic
  \item $N_{EXC,n}$ = 1, \quad $\forall$ n that process traffic
\end{itemize}

For this mode of transport it is also necessary to minimize CAPEX through equation \ref{Capex} where in this case for the cost of nodes we have in consideration electric \ref{Capex_Node_EXC} and optical cost \ref{Capex_Node_OXC}. In this case the value of $P_{exc,c,n}$ is obtained by equation \ref{EXC_pexc1_transluc} for short-reach and by the equation \ref{EXC_pexc2_transluc} for long-reach and the value of $P_{oxc,n}$ is obtained by equation \ref{OXC_poxc_transluc}.\\

The equation \ref{EXC_pexc1_transluc} refers to the number of short-reach ports of the electrical switch with bit-rate $c$ in node $n$, $P_{exc,c,n}$, i.e. the number of tributary ports with bit-rate $c$ in node $n$ which can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
P_{exc,c,n} = \sum_{d=1}^{N} D_{nd,c}
\label{EXC_pexc1_transluc}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $D_{nd,c}$ are the client demands between nodes $n$ and $d$ with bit rate $c$.\\

In this case there is the following particularity:
\begin{itemize}
  \item When $n$=$d$ the value of client demands is always zero, i.e, $D_{nn,c}=0$
\end{itemize}

As previously mentioned, the equation \ref{EXC_pexc2_transluc} refers to the number of long-reach ports of the electrical switch with bit-rate -1 in node n, $P_{exc,-1,n}$, i.e. the number of add ports of node n which can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
P_{exc,-1,n} = \sum_{k=1}^{N} \lambda_{nk}
\label{EXC_pexc2_transluc}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\lambda_{nk}$ is the number of optical channels between lightpath $n$ and node $k$.\\

The equation \ref{OXC_poxc_transluc} refers to the number of ports in optical switch in node n, $P_{oxc,n}$, i.e. the number of line ports and the number of adding ports of node n which can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
P_{oxc,n} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} f_{nj}^{pk} + \sum_{k=1}^{N} \lambda_{nk}
\label{OXC_poxc_transluc}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $f_{nj}^{pk}$ refers to the number of line ports for all lightpath pairs $(p,k)$ and $\lambda_{nk}$ refers to the number of add ports.\\

Taking into account that the variables defined previously for this mode of transport depend on the mode of survivability, in the following chapter it is already possible to calculate CAPEX.\\
