Once again in this case it is necessary to minimize CAPEX through equation \ref{Capex} where in this case for the cost of nodes we have in consideration electric \ref{Capex_Node_EXC} and optical cost \ref{Capex_Node_OXC}. In this case the value of $P_{exc,c,n}$ is obtained by equation \ref{EXC_pexc1_transparent} for short-reach and by the equation \ref{EXC_pexc2_transparent} for long-reach and the value of $P_{oxc,n}$ is obtained by equation \ref{OXC_poxc_transparent}.\\

The equation \ref{EXC_pexc1_transparent} refers to the number of short-reach ports of the electrical switch with bit-rate $c$ in node $n$, $P_{exc,c,n}$, i.e. the number of tributary ports with bit-rate $c$ in node $n$ which can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
P_{exc,c,n} = \sum_{d=1}^{N} D_{nd,c}
\label{EXC_pexc1_transparent}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $D_{nd,c}$ are the client demands between nodes $n$ and $d$ with bit rate $c$.\\

In this case there is the following particularity:
\begin{itemize}
  \item When $n$=$d$ the value of client demands is always zero, i.e, $D_{nn,c}=0$
\end{itemize}

As previously mentioned, the equation \ref{EXC_pexc2_transparent} refers to the number of long-reach ports of the electrical switch with bit-rate -1 in node n, $P_{exc,-1,n}$, i.e. the number of add ports of node n which can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
P_{exc,-1,n} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \lambda_{nj}
\label{EXC_pexc2_transparent}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\lambda_{nj}$ is the number of optical channels between node $n$ and node $j$.\\

The equation \ref{OXC_poxc_transparent} refers to the number of ports in optical switch in node n, $P_{oxc,n}$, i.e. the number of line ports and the number of adding ports of node n which can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
P_{oxc,n} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} f_{nj}^{od} + \sum_{j=1}^{N} \lambda_{nj}
\label{OXC_poxc_transparent}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $f_{nj}^{od}$ refers to the number of line ports for all demand pairs (od) and $\lambda_{nj}$ refers to the number of add ports.\\

In this case, again, the specific variables depend on the mode of survivability. With this in mind in the next chapter we can calculate CAPEX.\\
