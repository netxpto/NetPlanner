The total CAPEX of a network, as it was already described in \ref{Capex}, is the sum between two differentiated costs. Firstly, the link cost depends on the link length, which has integrated components such as OLTs, transceivers and amplifiers and the node cost depends on the traffic intensity by each node.

In order to get the results for the heuristic approach, some algorithms are used which try to obtain the most near optimal solution for the six cases detailed in this chapter. Then, it will be applied a cost report with all the detailed information about the costs of the network. The final CAPEX depends on the transport mode (opaque, transparent and translucent), possibility of the network having a dedicated 1+1 protection scheme or not and the network traffic (low - 0.5 Tbit/s, medium - 5 Tbit/s and high - 10 Tbit/s).

To calculate the total network cost it has to be considered the links cost and the nodes cost. The CAPEX value of a network, $C_C$, in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars), is calculated by the equation \ref{Capex_heuristic}

\begin{equation}
C_C = C_L + C_N
\label{Capex_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where

\begin{itemize}
\item{$C_L$				$\rightarrow$	Link cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}
\item{$C_N$				$\rightarrow$	Node cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}
\end{itemize}

On the first hand, the links' cost, $C_L$, in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars), is calculated by the equation \ref{Capex_Link_heuristic}. If the length of the link is longer, the resulting costs will be higher due to of the necessity of having more components which carry all the traffic from all origin nodes to all destination nodes

\begin{equation}
C_L = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=i+1}^N L_{ij} \left( 2 \gamma_0^{OLT} + 2 \gamma_1^{OLT} \tau W_{ij} + N^R_{ij} c^R \right)
\label{Capex_Link_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where

\begin{itemize}
\item{$i$               $\rightarrow$   Index for start node of a physical link}
\item{$j$               $\rightarrow$   Index for end node of a physical link}
\item{$N$				$\rightarrow$	Total number of nodes, N $\in \mathbb{N}$}
\item{$L_{ij}$			$\rightarrow$	Binary variable indicating if link between the nodes $i$ and $j$ is used, $L_{ij} \in {0, 1}$}
\item{$\gamma_0^{OLT}$	$\rightarrow$	OLT cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}
\item{$\gamma_1^{OLT}$	$\rightarrow$	Transponder cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}
\item{$\tau$		    $\rightarrow$	Line bit-rate}
\item{$W_{ij}$          $\rightarrow$   Number of optical channels in link $i$ $j$}
\item{$N^R_{ij}$    	$\rightarrow$	Number of optical amplifiers in link $i$ $j$}
\item{$c^R$				$\rightarrow$	Optical amplifiers cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}
\end{itemize}

The line bit-rate that is used in this report has the value of 100. It represents the separation between regeneration stages in km. On the other hand, the nodes' cost, $C_N$, in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars), is calculated by the equation \ref{Capex_Node_heuristic}

\begin{equation}
C_N = C_{EXC} + C_{OXC}
\label{Capex_Node_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where

\begin{itemize}
\item {$C_{EXC}$        $\rightarrow$   Electrical node cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}
\item {$C_{OXC}$        $\rightarrow$   Optical node cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}
\end{itemize}

\vspace{11pt}
As all the nodes have an electrical part and an optical part, it is necessary to calculate both with their respective formulas and sum the results. The constitution of the electrical node part can be seen in the Integer Linear Programming section \ref{exc_design}. The electrical nodes' cost, $C_{EXC}$, in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars), is given by the equation \ref{Capex_Node_EXC_heuristic}

\begin{equation}
C_{EXC} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} N_{exc,n} \left( \gamma_{e0} + \sum_{c=-1}^B \gamma_{e1,c} P_{exc,c,n} \right)
\label{Capex_Node_EXC_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where

\begin{itemize}
\item{$N$				$\rightarrow$	Total number of nodes, N $\in \mathbb{N}$}
\item{$N_{exc,n}$		$\rightarrow$	Binary variable indicating if node $n$ is used, $N_{exc,n} \in {0, 1}$}
\item{$\gamma_{e0}$ 	$\rightarrow$	EXC cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}
\item{$\gamma_{e1,c}$	$\rightarrow$	EXC port cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars) with bit-rate $B$ and with a given transceiver reach}
\item{$P_{exc,c,n}$	    $\rightarrow$	Number of ports of the electrical switch}
\item{$B$           	$\rightarrow$	A natural number corresponding to the maximum index of short-reach ports, see table below}
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
  \hline
  Index & Bit rate \\
 \hline\hline
  -1 & 100 Gbits/s line bit-rate (long-reach port) \\

\end{table}

The constitution of the optical node part can be seen in the Integer Linear Programming section \ref{oxc_design}. Finally, the optical nodes' cost, $C_{OXC}$, in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars), is given by the equation \ref{Capex_Node_OXC_heuristic}

\begin{equation}
C_{OXC} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} N_{oxc,n} \left( \gamma_{o0} + \gamma_{o1} P_{oxc,n} \right)
\label{Capex_Node_OXC_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where

\begin{itemize}
\item{$N$				$\rightarrow$	Total number of nodes, N $\in \mathbb{N}$}
\item{$N_{oxc,n}$		$\rightarrow$	Binary variable indicating if node $n$ is used, $N_{oxc,n} \in {0, 1}$}
\item{$\gamma_{o0}$ 	$\rightarrow$	OXC cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars)}
\item{$\gamma_{o1}$ 	$\rightarrow$	OXC port cost in monetary units (e.g. euros, or dollars) }
\item{$P_{oxc,n}$	    $\rightarrow$	Number of ports of the optical switch}
\end{itemize}
