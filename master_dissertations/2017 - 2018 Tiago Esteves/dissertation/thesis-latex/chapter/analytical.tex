\chapter{Analytical models}
\label{chap_analytical}
The focus of the current chapter is to propose and describe the analytical computation of the network CAPEX, based on the various modes of transport without survivability and protection.
In the following sections, all calculations for opaque and transparent modes of transport are presented in detail, without survivability and with 1+1 protection.
