\chapter{Conclusions and future directions}
\label{chap_conclusions}

In the framework of this master's thesis, ILP models were developed to minimize the CAPEX of a transport network. The thesis begins by proposing a reference network and three traffic scenarios. Then, ILP models for minimizing CAPEX considering the modes of transport and survivability are developed taking in consideration the various constraints and limitations of implementation. The analytical models of all cases are also described. Using the results obtained by the developed models and analytical models, the comparison is made with heuristic algorithms. Next, we review the work developed and summarize the main conclusions obtained. Finally, in Section \ref{future}, some suggestions for future work are presented.
